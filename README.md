# with-CBST-solve-shortest-paths-problem
This source code is ecoded by C++ and, implemented in console platform. This solution employs the CBST as priority heap to execute the best-first-search strategy. That conducts our algrithm able to transact mega data in more high efficiency than other guys and, becomes a truly linear program to solve this problem.
